# Midterm Quiz
This is my repository for the GIST 5300 Midterm Quiz Project. 

This website uses data from the National Park Service and the United States Geological Survey. Area and location data were hand entered in the glacier.js file based off of USGS data, and visitor data was constructed and calculated in Excel using data from NPS. Overall, this map gives a clear and concise view of visitor and glacier recession trends in Glacier National Park. I was also able to utilze plotly tools learned last semester in Dr. Chen Xu's GIST course.
